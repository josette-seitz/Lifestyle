Collaborating modern dance and Unity3D into one performance piece 

I heard this Claptone Clapcast mix when I heard Avicii sadly passed away and it got me thinking. Without music, the world would be such a different place and not a place I would want to live in. I have always wanted to use the components in Unity3D, code, and modern dance movements to create a create a storytelling piece about how "Music is my Lifestyle". The visuals contain Trail Renderers, Particle Systems, and a couple of C# scripts. I hope you enjoy! Click here to view video: https://youtu.be/CqhVovCMrYk
